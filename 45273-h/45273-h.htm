      Redcliffe; while few names on her roll of fame are more widely known than
      that of the ancient citizen to whom the stately fabric owes so much of its
      grace and beauty.

      And we grudge not the mead of praise. He who gives of his best to the
      service of God and his fellow men deserves high honour. But, when all is
      said, the work of William Canynge was as a drop in the ocean compared with
      that accomplished by the merchant-pilot, his contemporary and probable
      neighbour. Canynge helped to re-build a church; John Cabot discovered a
      continent, and secured it for all time to the English-speaking race. Yet
      the one has been remembered and revered; the other neglected and
      forgotten. An anomaly, perhaps accounted for by the fact that Bristol has
      ever been slow to recognise merit outside her borders, and John Cabot was
      an alien, while the claims of Sebastian, his son, to citizenship are still
      hotly contested; which is not surprising, as the evidence so far
      obtainable rests mainly upon the contradictory accounts of Sebastian
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To an unprejudiced mind, however, the assertion made by him to his friend
      Eden in old age, when he had no purpose in view and nothing to gain by it,
      "that he was borne in Bristowe, and at iiii. yeare ould he was carried
      with his father to Venice, and so returned agayne to England with his
      father after certayne years, whereby he was thought to have been borne in
      Venice," appears far more likely to be true than his statement in middle
      life to Contarini, the Venetian Ambassador, by which he sought to obtain
      wealth and honour, "I was borne in Venice, but was bred in England."

      Practically, the birthplace of either father or son is of little moment,
      even to Bristolians; nor the question of earlier voyages, so long as the
      great fact remains&mdash;That it was from Bristol port, in a Bristol ship,
      manned by Bristol sailors, on the initiative of Bristol merchants, that
      John Cabot sailed on that memorable May morning four hundred years ago;
      and that to Bristol port he returned in the following August, after having
      planted the flag of St. George on the eastern-most point of Cape Breton,
      in the Dominion of Canada, and taken possession of that great northern
      continent for the King of England!&mdash;An achievement, be it remembered,
      preceding by more than a year the landing of Columbus on the Southern
      continent.

    <p>
      That land across the wide Atlantic had been discovered long before Cabot
      sighted it is now generally admitted. Setting aside the claims of Madoc
      the Welshman and the Irish sailor-saint Brendan as not yet proven, it is
      certain that the Icelanders planted a colony in Greenland as early as the
      tenth century. The colony perished, but its traditions remained and were
      the inciting cause of later voyages; for Bristol merchants trading with
      Iceland, heard thereof and sent out ships in search of the "new land" for
      seven successive years before the the sailing of the "Matthew"&mdash;thinking
      to get by way of it to the Indies, or "far Cathay," the name given to all
      countries east of the Persian Gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for the future historian, Sebastian Cabot not only
      "romanced" concerning his birth-place, but also concerning his voyages; in
      consequence of which he has been, for centuries, honoured as the commander
      of the "Matthew" and the discoverer of America. Thanks, however, to modern
      research among musty rolls and ancient charters, it has been proved beyond
      a doubt that the commander of the Bristol ship and discoverer of the
      Continent was John Cabot. Whether Sebastian ever sailed at all on that
      first voyage is entirely conjectural. The evidence that he did rests
      mainly upon a reported conversation held with a stranger at Seville, in
      which he appears to have mixed up the discoveries of the first expedition
      with those of later ones, and ignoring his father's share, himself claimed
      credit for the whole!
    </p>
    <p>
      A modern writer suggests in excuse that he feared to excite the jealous
      displeasure of the King of Spain, in whose service he then was, by
      attracting attention to the prior discovery of a continent which his
      Catholic majesty would fain claim as his own. Perhaps, however, as the
      conversation was transcribed not at second, but at third hand, the
      indictment may be best taken with the proverbial grain of salt; and,
      certainly, both on Sebastian's portrait and on his famous "Mappamundi,"
      the claims of the elder Cabot are acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of John Cabot's birthplace no record exists, though some writers claim the
      honour for Bristol. Recent research, however, has proved him to have been
      of Norman extraction, descended from the Jersey Cabots or Chabots. In
      1476, for purposes of commerce, he became a Venetian citizen. When he
      first came to London "to follow the trade of merchandise" is uncertain;
      but he ultimately found his way to Bristol, which he appears to have made
      his home for some years. As strangers were not allowed to remain within
      the city to trade longer than forty days, in all probability he resided
      with his Venetian wife, among others of her nation, in the eastern suburb
      (the north and west were occupied by Jews) near to St. Mary Redcliffe,
      where a district still bears the suggestive name of "Cathay."
    </p>
    <p>
      An enterprising and wealthy merchant, Cabot was also an expert seaman,
      well versed in the science of navigation, and burning to take part in the
      search for those golden lands across the western ocean, whose existence
      mariners of all nations had so long suspected.

    <p>
      Among Bristol merchants, baffled in their own attempts to reach the goal,
      such a man was sure of meeting with not only sympathy, but ready
      co-operation. And in 1496 we find him obtaining from Henry VII. a charter,
      made out in the names of himself and his sons, Lewis, Sebastian, and
      Sanctus, empowering him and those associated with him to fit out sundry
      vessels to search for new lands, and take possession of them in the name
      of the King, he and his heirs to occupy such lands as Henry's vassals and
      trade therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Matthew," a small vessel, was accordingly fitted out, sixteen Bristol
      men and a Burgundian forming the crew, and in her Cabot set sail from the
      ancient port, May 2nd, 1497.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voyaging nearly due west, he, to quote from the contemporary letter of
      Lorenzo Pasqualigo, "wandered about a long time, and at length hit land"&mdash;not
      Bonavista, Newfoundland, nor Cape Chidley, Labrador,&mdash;whose shores
      are ice-bound at that season; but Cape Breton, the easternmost point of
      Nova Scotia;&mdash;"he coasted 300 leagues and landed; saw no human
      beings, but brought to the King certain snares which had been set to catch
      game, and a needle for making nets; he also found some felled trees,
      wherefore supposing there were inhabitants, he returned to his ship in
      alarm." Two islands were subsequently sighted (St. John's and
      Newfoundland), but shortness of provisions compelled Cabot to return
      homewards without landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, after an absence of three months, the little ship, having safely
      braved the perils of those unknown seas and inhospitable shores, sailed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Up the Avon's gentle flood and under Clifton's height"
    </p>
    <p>
      to her old anchorage beside the Quay.

    <p>
      On the 10th of August, her captain was in London relating his discoveries
      to the King. Henry was so pleased with Cabot's success that he gave him a
      pension of £20 for life, and "£10 to him who found (first sighted) the new
      isle." Pasqualigo tells how he was styled the "Great Admiral," dressed in
      rich silks, and had vast honours paid him, the English running after him
      "like mad people."

    <p>
      In these rejoicings Bristolians, we may be sure, took a prominent part,
      and many a city father and wealthy merchant, when office and shop were
      closed for the day, would wend his way across the ancient bridge and up
      Redcliffe Street to Cabot's home in "Cathay," to hear his stories of those
      distant lands, and see the wondrous things he had brought therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      One relic, and one only, of that voyage Bristol still retains&mdash;the
      famous "rib of the Dun Cow" (cow-whale) preserved with religious care in
      Redcliffe Church; the following interesting reference to which was
      discovered in recent times among the City records. "1497&mdash;Item. Paid
      for settynge upp ye bone of ye bigge fyshe and... (writing illegible) hys
      worke brote over seas, vid. For two rings of iron iiijd."
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Socino, who wrote on Dec. 18th of this same year, Cabot
      recorded his discoveries on a map and also on a globe; but no trace of
      either has been found, although La Cosa must have had access to them for
      his map.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following year, 1498, the King granted a supplementary charter in
      the name of John Cabot only, authorising him to take out six ships to the
      "lande and isles of late founde by the said John," at his own cost, to
      trade and colonize; giving him for the latter purpose "300 prisoners"&mdash;doubtless
      glad enough to be rid of them, the gaols being full to overflowing just
      then in consequence of Perkin Warbeck's rebellion. Bounties were also
      allowed to "James Carter, Thos. Bradley, and Lancelot Thirkill, of
      Bristowe" for fitting out three of the ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expedition sailed, made further discoveries, and returned; but whether
      it was under the control of John Cabot is not known, for here all record
      of the elder Cabot ceases.

    <p>
      Sebastian says his father died about this time, but he gives neither date
      or place of burial. It seems most probable that John Cabot's death
      occurred at sea, and that Sebastian, who&mdash;though this has been
      contested&mdash;accompanied him on this voyage, returned in command.
      Strangely enough, no account of the expedition appears to exist among
      English records; the sole fact of its return being gathered from the
      presence in London of Lancelot Thirkill, June 6, 1501, and his repayment
      of the loan he had had of the King. From foreign sources, however, we know
      that it was John Cabot's intention in this expedition to follow the shore
      from his former discovery till he reached the equinoctial regions; and we
      also know that (whether under his command or that of Sebastian) the plan
      was pursued until lack of provisions compelled its abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second expedition, taking a more northerly course than the first,
      visited Iceland, and then steering west, made the coast of Labrador, named
      by Cabot "De la Terra de los Baccalaos," "The Land of the Cod-fish," from
      the immense shoals of those fish which they encountered. Landing the
      colonists, though whereabouts in that inhospitable region is not stated,
      they sailed still farther to the north-west&mdash;through Hudson's Straits&mdash;until
      "affrighted by the monstrous heaps of ice swimming in the sea, and the
      continual daylight," they dared go no further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retracing their course they found many of the colonists dead of cold and
      hunger, and re-embarking the remainder, they sailed south as far as Cape
      Hatteras, when provisions failing, the little flotilla returned to England&mdash;Unsuccessful,
      the merchants who had freighted the vessels deemed, for they had not found
      the golden goal of Cathay nor even established a trading colony! But in
      reality successful beyond the wildest dreams of King or people, for there
      is no doubt that the Cabot charter and the voyages made pursuant to it,
      were always regarded as the root of England's title to her American
      possessions, and that, "to the daring and genius of Cabot is owing the
      occupation of the northern continent by an English-speaking race, with
      their vast energies and wealth. But for the Cabots Spain might have
      monopolized discovery in North as well as in South America."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eschewing the "trade of merchandise," Sebastian Cabot appears to have
      devoted himself entirely to nautical science; attaining such eminence
      that, on the death of Columbus, the King of Spain engaged his services as
      Cartographer, at a salary of 30,000 maravedas, intending to send him on
      another voyage. Before the design could be carried out, Ferdinand died,
      and Sebastian returned to England.

      Under the auspices of Henry VIII., he is said to have again crossed the
      Atlantic, seeking a passage to India through Hudson's Bay. The attempt
      failed, and after surveying the bay, and studying the variations of the
      magnetic needle, Cabot returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years later he was again in the service of Spain, engaged under the
      young Emperor, Charles V., as Pilot-major, at a largely increased salary.
      This post he retained during the greater part of Charles' reign. It was
      while holding it that he made to Contarini those dishonest offers of
      information and those misleading statements concerning his birth, which
      have proved so prolific in controversy to his biographers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1526, Cabot commanded a Spanish expedition to Brazil, which although he
      penetrated some distance into the interior, ended disastrously, and
      resulted in his being imprisoned for a year on the charge of
      "mismanagement and excesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first count of the indictment may have been true. Very probably the
      great cartographer was not skilled in the management of men. As Oviedo,
      the Spanish historian, sapiently remarked, "it is not the same thing to
      command and govern people as to point a quadrant or an astrolabe"; but the
      "excesses" charged against him were far more likely to have been committed
      by the Portugese, who had sent out a rival expedition, and to whose
      malicious intrigues and jealous interference the disasters of the
      Spaniards were mainly due. Untruthful and covetous of honours and gold,
      Sebastian has been proved; but that he was also kindly, gentle, and
      humane, there is no doubt; while his mode of treating the natives may be
      gathered from his "Instructions" for the ordering of a similar expedition
      in later years.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in the employ of Spain, Cabot made his "Mappamundi," or Map of the
      World. This famous map, which not only presented his own and his father's
      discoveries, but those of Spain and Portugal down to his own time, was
      drawn on parchment and illuminated with gold and colours. The original was
      sold on the death of the President of the Council of the Indies in 1575,
      and has never since been heard of. Several engravings of it were made,
      only one of which is now known; that in the Galerie de Géographie, Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after Henry VIII. death, the Council of the young King, Edward,
      induced Cabot to return to England, and, according to Strype, he settled
      in Bristol, 1548.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles V., through his ambassador, commanded his return; but the Privy
      Council replied that "he refused to go either into Spain or to the
      Emperor, and that, being of that mind, <i>and the King's subject</i>, no
      reason or equity would that he should be forced against his will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles immediately stopped his pension, but Edward replaced it by one of
      250 marks, and Cabot continued in the service of England until his death,
      exercising a kind of general supervision over the maritime affairs of the
      Kingdom, and adding to his store of charts and "discourses."

    <p>
      In 1551, a general stagnation of trade pervaded England, and the London
      merchants consulted Cabot, who had just succeeded in breaking the monopoly
      of the German "Merchants of the Steelyard," as to what steps could be
      taken to revive it. Through his advice they formed themselves into the
      "Company of Merchant Adventurers of London" (of which the Bristol
      "Merchant Venturers" is an outcome) for the search and discovery of the
      northern part of the world by sea, and to open a way and passage to Cathay
      by the north-east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabot, in recognition of his services, was made Governor for life, and
      immediately set about building new ships, the keels of which he covered
      with lead after the Spanish fashion, thus being the first to introduce the
      custom of "sheathing" into England.

    <p>
      Great was the rejoicing when the first expedition put to sea, May 20th,
      1553. The ships were towed down the Thames by boats, "and being come neare
      to Greenwich, where the Court then lay, the courtiers came running out,
      and the common people flocked together upon the shores in crowdes; the
      Privy Council they lookt out of the windowes of the Court, and the rest
      ranne up to the toppes of the towers," while the "skies rang agayne with
      the shouts of the mariners and the firing of the shippe's ordnance." But,
      alas! the young king who would have taken so keen an interest in the show,
      being well learned in all matters pertaining to the sea, was lying sick
      unto death in his room in the Palace, and e'er the ships were well on
      their way he had breathed his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expedition, and others that followed, succeeded in opening up Russia
      and extending English trade across the Caspian Sea into Central Asia&mdash;to
      the jubilant delight of the organiser of them! Stephen Boroughs, who
      commanded the last of these expeditions (a little pinnace called the
      "Swiftsure") gives the following quaint picture of the Ancient Mariner,
      who came aboard the pinnace to see them off:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The goode olde gentleman, Master Cabota, gave to the poore most liberall
      almes, wishing them to praye for the good fortune and prosperous successe
      of the 'Serchthrift,' our pinnesse. And then, at the sign of the
      Christopher, he and his friends banketted, and made me and them that were
      in the companie great cheere; and, for very joy that he had to see the
      towardness of our intended discovery, he enter'd into the dance himself,
      amongst the rest of the younge and lusty company; which being ended, he
      and his friends departed, most gently commending us to the governance of
      Almighty God."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the last public appearance of Cabot of which we have any record.
      How long he lived, or where he died, is not known, and can only be
      inferred from the facts that his pension ceased to be drawn after 1557,
      and that Eden, who lived in London, was present at his deathbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only literary relics of Cabot known to exist are the engraved map of
      1544 and its facsimile. Of his other "remains," voluminous though they
      must have been, there is no trace. Hakluyt, writing of Cabot in 1582,
      says, "Shortly shall come out in print all his own mappes and discourses
      drawne and written by himselfe, which are in the custody of the Worshipful
      Master William Worthington." The publication was never made, and no one
      knows what has become of them. It is, however, strongly suspected that
      they found their way to Spain, through the instrumentality of the said
      "Master Worthington" (Cabot's associate in office), who seems to have been
      but indifferent honest. If this were so, there is hope that they are still
      in existence and may some day be restored.

    <p>
      One relic we had of Cabot&mdash;the famous portrait, painted when he was
      an old man, and which in 1625, hung in the King's gallery at Whitehall. In
      1792, this picture was presented to Charles J. Harford, Esquire, of
      Bristol, who discovered it while in Scotland; but, unfortunately for
      Bristolians, he sold it to Mr. John Biddle of Pittsburg, and it perished
      in the destruction of that gentleman's house by fire in 1848. Several
      copies exist in America, and an excellent engraving of the picture was
      made by Rawle of Bristol. Cabot is represented in his robe and chain as
      Governor of the Merchant Adventurers. There is also a painting of John
      Cabot and his three sons in the Ducal Palace, Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the maps and charts of the Cabots are so far, lost to us whom
      they most concern, clear traces of them exist in the work of foreign
      cosmographers, and especially in the famous map of Juan de la Cosa,
      published in 1501, only three years after the voyage of John Cabot; where
      the row of British flags, commencing at the southern end with <i>Mar
      descubierta por inglese</i>, "sea discovered by the English;" and ending
      at the north with <i>Cavo de ynglaterra</i>, "Cape of England," mark
      unmistakably the discoveries of Cabot, and could have been obtained only
      from his map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most curious evidence, however, comes from none other than the supreme
      Pontiff himself, and testifies, not only to the fact of Cabot's
      discoveries, but also that he hailed from Bristol!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the British Museum is a facsimile, by Wm. Griggs, of the original
      "Carta Universal," or Chart of the World, preserved in the "Propaganda" at
      Rome, by which Pope Alexander VI. divided the unclaimed lands of the globe
      between Spain and Portugal. On this unique chart the Northern Continent
      ends at Labrador, which is described as a country "which was discovered by
      the English of the town of Bristol, and which is of no use!"

    <h2>
      BRANDON HILL, BRISTOL
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Site of the Cabot Memorial.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Brandon Hill, the site of Bristol's memorial to the Cabots, lies between
      the north-west portion of the city and the wooded heights of Clifton.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      A fringe of houses encircles the base, but the remainder of its
      twenty-five acres, up to the rounded summit, 250 feet high, is open
      greensward, with gravelled paths, and seats under shady hawthorne bushes&mdash;the
      happy haunt of children from all parts of the city; and, as evening
      spreads her dusky mantle around, of whispering lovers, every seat
      accommodating a pair, sometimes two!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hill takes its name from the Irish saint, Brendan, a chapel and
      hermitage dedicated to him having once stood on its summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This St. Brendan is said to have been a great sailor, and claims to have
      himself discovered land across the Atlantic. Whether the claim be true or
      false, certain it is that the story of his "voyages," and the golden
      legends connected therewith, aroused men's curiosity and incited to
      subsequent expeditions, which, nearly a thousand years after Brendan's
      death, resulted in the discovery of the Northern Continent. The choice,
      therefore, of "St. Brendon's Hill" for the site of the memorial of that
      discovery is peculiarly appropriate; more especially as Brendan was the
      patron saint of sailors, and his chapel much frequented by Bristol
      mariners.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first known occupant of the hermitage, in 1351, was "Lucy de
      Newchurch," who, tired of the world, begged permission to immure herself
      therein. Fifty years later it was tenanted by a hermit, Reginald Taylor.
      Bluff King Hal, however, made short work of both chapel and hermitage, and
      in the troubled times of the Civil War a fort took their place, traces of
      which still remain. It is upon the site of this fort, recently occupied by
      two Russian cannon, that the memorial tower will stand. In digging out the
      foundations was discovered, beneath the soft concrete of the chapel, a
      grave containing human bones, which, in all probability, are those of the
      ancient denizens of the spot!

      No finer view of Bristol and its environs can be obtained anywhere than
      from the Hill. On the right rise the woods and mansions of Clifton, and
      its Parish Church, "severely simple!" In the valley between is Jacobs
      Wells, the old Jewish quarter. The City schools were built on the ancient
      burial ground, which gave rise to the witty if gruesome remark that,
      "whatever the boys might lack they were always sure of a good Hebrew
      foundation." Thanks to Queen Elizabeth, the boys' mothers have been always
      sure of a good "drying ground!" Her Majesty having secured to them for all
      time a portion of this side of the Hill for laundry purposes; in
      recognition, it is said, of the faultless style in which their progenitors
      "got up" the immense ruffles worn by herself when visiting the City.
      Immediately on the left is St. Michael's Hill, the site of another large
      fort; and Tyndall's Park and mansion, still possessed by a branch of the
      family whence sprang William Tyndall, the translator of the Bible, the
      only perfect copy of whose first edition is still preserved in the Baptist
      College hard by. Beyond, and spreading for miles along the valley, bounded
      on its opposite side by Bedminster Downs and Dundry Hill, lies the City
      with its churches and schools, its ancient buildings (now, alas! rapidly
      disappearing), its modern warehouses and factories, its venerable
      cathedral and historic "green," encircled by avenues of limes. And,
      intersecting its southern side, the floating harbour, formed by the Avon
      and Frome, and bearing on its capacious bosom the merchandise of many
      lands, carried in craft of all sizes, from the tiny coasting lugger to the
      huge, perfectly equipped Atlantic steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not a ship among them all, going or coming, but must pass within full
      view of Brandon Hill, whose long southern slope stretches to within a few
      hundred yards of the water's edge!

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
